# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Tried out several different aproaches to make pomodoro countdown timer, nothing seemed to work the way I wanted it to. Still cant set the time. 
jQuery plugin allows me to pause time and set time easily.
Lernt more about setInterval().

**Thoughts:** I'm struggling with finding out how to make a timer that counts down.
